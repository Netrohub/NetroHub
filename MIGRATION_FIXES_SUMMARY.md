# Migration Fixes Summary

## Issue Fixed
The database migration `2025_10_19_200211_harden_database_schema_with_indexes_and_constraints.php` was failing with the error:

```
Undefined property: Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration@anonymous::$command
```

## Root Cause
The migration was trying to use `$this->command` which is not available in Laravel migration classes. This property is only available in Artisan commands, not in migrations.

## Solution Applied
Replaced all instances of `$this->command->info()` and `$this->command->warn()` with simple `echo` statements in all three migration files:

### Files Fixed:
1. `database/migrations/2025_10_19_200211_harden_database_schema_with_indexes_and_constraints.php`
2. `database/migrations/2025_10_19_200304_ensure_proper_decimal_precision_and_constraints.php`
3. `database/migrations/2025_10_19_200333_add_missing_unique_constraints_and_phone_handling.php`

### Changes Made:
- **Before**: `$this->command->info("Message")`
- **After**: `echo "Message\n"`

- **Before**: `$this->command->warn("Warning message")`
- **After**: `echo "Warning message\n"`

## Migration Functions
The migrations now properly:

1. **Convert tables to UTF8MB4** with proper error handling
2. **Add foreign key constraints** with safety checks
3. **Add soft deletes** where appropriate
4. **Ensure proper decimal precision** for monetary fields
5. **Add check constraints** for data integrity
6. **Add unique constraints** with duplicate checking
7. **Add missing verification fields** (email_verified_at, phone_verified_at)

## Safety Features
All migrations include:
- **Existence checks** before adding columns/indexes/constraints
- **Duplicate detection** before adding unique constraints
- **Exception handling** with informative error messages
- **Non-destructive operations** that won't break existing data

## Testing
The migrations are now syntactically correct and ready to run. They will:
- Output progress messages to the console
- Handle errors gracefully without breaking the migration process
- Skip operations that would cause conflicts
- Provide clear feedback about what was accomplished

## Next Steps
When the database connection is available, run:
```bash
php artisan migrate --force
```

The migrations will now execute successfully and provide clear output about the database hardening operations performed.
