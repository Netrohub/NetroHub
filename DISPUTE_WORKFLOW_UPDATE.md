# 🔄 Dispute System - Updated Workflow

## ✅ Changes Made

The dispute system has been updated to reflect a **buyer-seller first** approach, with moderators only stepping in when needed.

---

## 📊 New Dispute Flow

```
1. Buyer creates dispute
         ↓
2. Seller receives notification
         ↓
3. Buyer & Seller communicate directly
         ↓
4a. Seller resolves → Mark as "Resolved by Seller"
    ↓
    Buyer satisfied? → Closed ✅
    Buyer not satisfied? → Escalate to Moderator
         ↓
4b. Can't resolve → Either party escalates
         ↓
5. Moderator reviews & makes final decision
         ↓
6. Both parties notified of resolution
```

## 💡 How It Works

### Scenario 1: Quick Resolution
1. Buyer: "Product doesn't work"
2. Seller: "Here's how to fix it..."
3. Buyer tries fix, it works
4. Seller marks as resolved
5. Buyer is satisfied, doesn't escalate
6. ✅ Resolved without moderator

### Scenario 2: Seller Can't Help
1. Buyer: "Product doesn't work"
2. Seller: "Try this..."
3. Buyer: "Still doesn't work"
4. Buyer escalates to moderators
5. Moderator reviews evidence
6. Moderator decides and notifies both
7. ✅ Fair resolution by moderator

### Scenario 3: Buyer Disagrees with Seller
1. Buyer: "Product not as described"
2. Seller: "It is as described, here's proof"
3. Seller marks as resolved
4. Buyer disagrees, escalates
5. Moderator reviews both sides
6. Moderator makes final decision
7. ✅ Impartial moderation
