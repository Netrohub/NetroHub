# 🎯 Final Update: Buyer Controls Resolution

## ✅ Critical Change

**Only the BUYER can mark a dispute as resolved** - this makes perfect sense since the buyer is the one with the complaint!

---

## 🔄 Updated Flow

```
1. Buyer creates dispute
         ↓
2. Buyer & Seller communicate
         ↓
3. Buyer decides outcome:
    
    Option A: Issue Fixed
    → Buyer marks as "Resolved" ✅
    → Dispute closed
    
    Option B: Not Fixed/Need Help
    → Buyer escalates to Moderators 🚨
    → Moderator reviews & decides
```

---

## 🎯 New Status Flow

| Status | Controlled By | Meaning |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| `open` | System | Active discussion |
| `resolved` | **Buyer Only** | Buyer satisfied, issue fixed |
| `escalated` | Buyer or Seller | Sent to moderators |
| `in_review` | Moderator | Under review |
| `resolved_refund` | Moderator | Refund approved |
| `resolved_upheld` | Moderator | Seller upheld |
