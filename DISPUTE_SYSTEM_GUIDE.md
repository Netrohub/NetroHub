## API Integration (Future Enhancement)

The system is ready for API integration. You can add REST endpoints:

```php
// api.php
Route::middleware('auth:sanctum')->group(function () {
    Route::apiResource('disputes', DisputeApiController::class);
    Route::post('disputes/{dispute}/messages', [DisputeApiController::class, 'addMessage']);
});
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Create dispute as buyer
- [ ] Respond as seller
- [ ] Upload evidence files
- [ ] Send messages between parties
- [ ] Mark dispute as in review (admin)
- [ ] Add internal notes (admin)
- [ ] Send public messages (admin)
- [ ] Resolve dispute with refund
- [ ] Resolve dispute upholding seller
- [ ] Check all email notifications
- [ ] Test mobile responsive design
- [ ] Verify file download functionality

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**: Buyer creates dispute â†’ Seller responds â†’ Moderator resolves fairly
2. **Evidence Heavy**: Multiple file uploads from both parties
3. **Long Conversation**: Extended back-and-forth messaging
4. **Quick Resolution**: Immediate moderator intervention
5. **Seller No Response**: Buyer creates dispute, seller doesn't respond

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Total disputes created per month
- Average resolution time
- Percentage resolved in favor of buyer vs seller
- Most common dispute reasons
- Seller dispute rate

### Database Queries for Analytics
```php
// Average resolution time
Dispute::whereNotNull('resolved_at')
    ->selectRaw('AVG(TIMESTAMPDIFF(HOUR, created_at, resolved_at)) as avg_hours')
    ->first();

// Disputes by status
Dispute::selectRaw('status, COUNT(*) as count')
    ->groupBy('status')
    ->get();

// Top dispute reasons
Dispute::selectRaw('reason, COUNT(*) as count')
    ->groupBy('reason')
    ->orderByDesc('count')
    ->limit(10)
    ->get();
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Files not uploading
- **Solution**: Check storage permissions: `chmod -R 775 storage`
- **Solution**: Ensure storage is linked: `php artisan storage:link`

**Issue**: Notifications not sending
- **Solution**: Check queue is running: `php artisan queue:work`
- **Solution**: Verify email configuration in `.env`

**Issue**: 403 Forbidden errors
- **Solution**: Check user has proper roles via `isAdmin()` method
- **Solution**: Verify middleware is applied to routes

**Issue**: Messages not appearing
- **Solution**: Check `is_internal` flag filter
